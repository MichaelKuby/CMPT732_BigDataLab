Questions I've had trouble with and could learn from:


1. What is the range of the purchase dates?

SELECT datediff(days, MIN(pdate), MAX(pdate)) FROM purchases


2. How many customers are there from each province and territory?

SELECT COUNT(province), province FROM customers
GROUP BY province


3. What are the average and median purchase amounts?

SELECT AVG(amount), MEDIAN(amount) FROM purchases



4. What's in greater_vancouver_prefixes?

SELECT * FROM greater_vancouver_prefixes

Aldergrove	V2Z	
Burnaby	V5B	
Coquitlam	V3E	
Delta	V4K	
Gold Creek	V0B	
Lions Bay	V0N	

5. QUESTION 1: DEBIT OR CREDIT?

Do people from Ontario tend to put larger purchases on one payment method?

Ontario -> table: customers PK: custid

Amount -> table: purchases PK: purchid REFERENCES: customers(custid), paymentmethods(pmid), amenities(amenid)

Method -> table: paymentmethods PK: pmid REFERENCES: customers(custid)

QUERY:

SELECT mtype, MEDIAN(amount)
FROM customers
JOIN purchases ON customers.custid = purchases.custid
JOIN paymentmethods ON customers.custid = paymentmethods.custid AND purchases.pmid = paymentmethods.pmid
WHERE customers.province='ON'
GROUP BY paymentmethods.mtype

RESULTS:

debit	30.83	
credit	37.24	

Prose Answer: From the results we can see that the median amount spent on credit cards by customers from Ontario is higher (37.24) than what they spend 
on debit (30.83).
